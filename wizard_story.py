    You wake up to find yourself in darkness.
    You try to feel around but all you can feel is the cold ground and hear some water dripping.
    As your eyes start to adjust to the darkness you look around once more and come face to face with a skeleton.
    You jump back and see that it is wearing shackles, ‘How did I get here?’.
    You get up and as you try to find a way out you accidentally stub your toe on a large stick, ow.
    You pick it up and you see that it has a large gem on the top of it, you start handling it to see how it feels.
    It seemed to you to be a magic staff, how you knew that even you don’t know.
    You look back at the skeleton and get some shivers down your spine.
    You squint your eyes and see some writing scratched into the wall next to it.
    You walk close to it and read it out loud.
    “Say... fireball?” FOOOOSH, there's a sudden burst of light as a large ball of fire emerges on the gem from the top of the staff you are holding.
    You thrust the staff towards the only door and only way out you can find and the entrance explodes open.
    You peek your head out and see bookshelf after bookshelf in the room before you.
    You head to the books and start reading them, many not making sense to you at first you start to understand the cryptic language in which these books are written in.
    You read a few pages and realise that it's a spell book, the page you’re reading is titled ‘Invisibility’.
    As you continue to read the page you hear multiple pairs of footsteps coming towards you from a set of stairs.
        What do you do?
        a) You quickly run to the stairs, ready to bonk anyone on the head with your staff.
        b) Cast fireball.
        c) Cast invisibility,

    You hide behind a bookshelf that is right next to the staircase and hold the staff above your head.
    Two peasants walk down the stairs behind a very large shrouded man with a large axe in both hands.
    You hear one of the peasants whisper to the other peasant, `Oh no, the wizard has escaped.’.
    You sneak up behind them and whack one of the peasants over the head.
    He falls to the ground and the other peasant sees you and points at you with a shaky hand.
    It seems like he is trying to talk but no words are coming out of his mouth.
    You hit him across the head with your staff and he falls over.
    As you look towards the large man with the large axe you see that he is face to face with you.
